# DevOps Portfolio Project

This project documents my personal journey of learning and applying core DevOps principles. The goal is to build a complete CI/CD pipeline from code commit to cloud deployment.

## 🚀 Project Goal

To build a fully automated system that takes a simple web application, tests it, packages it, and deploys it onto a cloud server. This project serves as my hands-on learning ground for essential DevOps tools.

## 📋 Current Status

- I have done phase one today, where I had to push the code remote repo.
- I have triggered the ci for that repo.
- I have used github actions for pipeline.
- the pipeline is triggered when used commit changes to the repo.
- in ci I have linting the code using super-lint.
- this super linting just checks that code have proper structure.
- I have two issues in linting. one is regarding the formatting of Readme file.
- other is permission from github to send the 
report back from guthub actions machine.
- I have cleared both the issue. now the pipeline is running successfully.
- I have also learned about the Git pull command. what it does is it updates the local repo with remote repo.
